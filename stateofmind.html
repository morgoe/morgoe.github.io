					State of Mind was a 24 hour design challenge set by OzChi. Myself and four other designers - Mark Mitchell, Emila Yang, Hanley Weng and Adam Younis - set out at 8am on Saturday morning with the design brief:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Design a system that takes advantage of cloud computing, mobile devices, and fast mobile networks to enhance the way people interact with each other collaboratively"
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					We each split up and researched different areas before presenting our findings to the group. The key points were:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The devices we use to share are often themselves isolated, but are becoming more and more synchronised.
						</li>
						<li>
							A lot of contextually aware technology development is going into creating social or serendipitous experiences.
						</li>
						<li>
							The concept of <em>"embodied knowledge"</em> â€” situational experience which helps us experience, understand and interact with the world.
						</li>
					</ul>

					We started to brainstorm some ideas around one simple question:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"What can be done with technology but not in person?"

			<h3 class="title">The Final Design</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					The personal spaces we situate ourselves in are often best described by the surrounding environmental factors. Contexts like location, time of day and collaborators are all used as qualifiers to identify different kinds of work. This said, our mental model is most often bound internally as current technology fails to afford for this behaviour.
				</p>
				<p>
					State of Mind addresses this directly by intelligently loading relevant applications, preferences, documents, and media automatically when entering a contextually defined space. As users naturally utilise physical space to communicate, their virtual states adapt dynamically, allowing for an immediate edge that requires no set-up, inherently enhancing collaboration.
