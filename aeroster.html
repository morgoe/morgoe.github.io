						<p>Chris approached me to help design an app he’d been thinking about since he was a kid. His dad was a pilot, and was in and away from home non-stop. The golden rule was the roster, but they were incomprehensible, especially to a 6-year-old.</p>

						<p>Chris had been accepted into the <em><a href="http://avroaccelerator.qantas.com/">Qantas AVRO Accelerator Program</a></em>. He had 12 weeks in total, and he was already two weeks in. We needed to build him something to present to investors at the end of the program.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, I was tied up with other projects and wasn’t able to start working immediately. Chris’ schedule was tight, so I got some help from my friend and excellent designer Emila. She worked the first few weeks designing the wireframes and user flows, and then I took over. So I had a pretty good base to start with.</p>

				<div class="grid-item when-lg-6">
					<p>Chris had contracted out branding to an agency, so my first step was to start turning Emila’s wireframes into hi-fidelity designs using the branding as a basis. However, it quickly became apparent that the branding didn’t suit the product.</p>

					<p>After our radical redesign, Chris dumped his old agency, hired a new guy, and produced an incredible logo. We picked fonts, colours, icons, and produced a coherent, clean design system.</p>

					<p>With such a short time, and wanting to cover as much ground as possible, we went with a web application (Vue+Django), but focused on mobile users. The desktop version made proper use of the available real estate, but there’s nothing you can’t do on mobile.</p>

					<p>I’m no illustrator, but we needed illustrations. I used our chosen icon pack as a base to create some simple, beautiful illustrations that we could pepper throughout the app.</p>
