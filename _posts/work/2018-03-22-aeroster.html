subhero_description:   "<p>Chris approached me to help design an app he’d been thinking about since he was a kid. His dad was a pilot, and was in and away from home non-stop. The golden rule was the roster, but they were incomprehensible, especially to a 6-year-old.</p><p>Chris had been accepted into the <em><a href='http://avroaccelerator.qantas.com/'>Qantas AVRO Accelerator Program</a></em>. He had 12 weeks in total, and he was already two weeks in. We needed to build him something to present to investors at the end of the program.</p>"

			<p>Unfortunately, I was tied up with other projects and wasn’t able to start working immediately. Chris’ schedule was tight, so I got some help from my friend and excellent designer Emila. She worked the first few weeks designing the wireframes and user flows, and then I took over. So I had a pretty good base to start with.</p>

			<p>Chris had contracted out branding to an agency, so my first step was to start turning Emila’s wireframes into hi-fidelity designs using the branding as a basis. However, it quickly became apparent that the branding didn’t suit the product.</p>

			<p>I’m no illustrator, but we needed illustrations. I used our chosen icon pack as a base to create some simple, beautiful illustrations that we could pepper throughout the app.</p>
