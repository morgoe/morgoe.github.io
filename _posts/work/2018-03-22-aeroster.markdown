It can be hard sometimes to convey the value of hiring a freelancer over an in-house, permanent designer. I’ve decided the best way to do this is to be as transparent as possible with the design process of working with a freelancer. So here’s how I helped Medify launch a product in 8 weeks.

We structured both the data visualizations and the visual design in a way that communicated this hierarchy. Data visualizations began at a “zoomed out” level, and as users dived down into areas of interest, the app would animate in and out in 3D space.

Repeated iterations of user testing helped us get closer to our goals. This video demonstrates some of the small UI interactions." %}

We then began on the complex task of creating the data visualization “widgets,” each with a unique insight. We began with sketching, wireframing, and prototyping, and then I built the widget templates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The templates were then handed over to the development team to hook into the database.

We finally worked on the visual design together, using quirky typefaces and bold (yet colorblind-friendly) colors and allowing teams to select fun, custom-built avatars to express their identities.
