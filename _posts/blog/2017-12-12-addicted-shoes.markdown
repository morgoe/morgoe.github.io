When I was about 10, I got my first pair of orthotics. I had flat feet, I was told, and by wearing these slips of plastic in my shoes, they would correct the arches in my feet. It was a temporary thing—a crutch, if you will. 

10 years later I went to get my 3rd or 4th pair of orthotics. The podiatrist asked me to walk barefoot on a treadmill while he filmed my gait. I watched it back and was horrified. My ankles were rolling inwards severely, with every step the entire weight of my body was being placed on the instep of my foot and my ankles were being crushed at a 45degree angle. 

So he gave me a new pair of orthotics. These ones were a little bit flexible, so they’d train the muscles in my foot to build the arches up. $1000. Thank you very much. 

A year or two later my feet were the same. I’d started to do yoga and noticed my flat feet more and more. They weren’t improving. The orthotics weren’t helping. 

So I threw them away. They were stopping my feet from building the muscles they were intending to. $1000, straight in the bin. 

My feet improved a little, but I still had flat feet. 

Why does everyone today have flat feet? And poor posture and bad backs at 30, and a dislike of their body in general? How the hell did cavemen survive with flat feet?

I ask myself this a lot whenever there is some malaise that seems inseparable from the majority of humans. We grew 

Humans are an incredibly complex system that developed over billions of years, but it developed to live in the wild. Cavemen didn’t get flat feet because they never wore shoes and they walked on unpredictable terrain. 

Why?? I can’t remember 




One day I met Kit Laughlin, founder of Stretch Therapy, who advocates for no shoes.
