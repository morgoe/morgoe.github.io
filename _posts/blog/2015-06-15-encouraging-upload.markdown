So now that you’ve got beautiful placeholder avatars, let’s focus on encouraging our users to upload a display photo.

### Make it part of onboarding

A number of products include this as a step in the onboarding process, often making it difficult to skip.

However, this can be a tradeoff. Make it too easy to skip, and some users will. Make it too hard, and some might abandon the product before completing the onboarding.

### Reasons and rewards

Whenever you’re asking something of a user, it’s always helpful to give them a reason (why the user should give the data) and a reward (what benefits it will bring the user). 

On social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, almost everyone uploads a display photo. It’s no wonder they don’t bother with the solutions outlined in [Placeholder Avatars](/design-solutions/placeholder-avatars).

A display photo on Facebook is a way for users to express themselves, and users are rewarded for uploading a display photo with likes and comments from other users - social validation.

A display photo on LinkedIn is important for users to identify themselves to potential connections, and to project a certain image. Users are rewarded when uploading a display photo, again with *likes, but more importantly, potential business *shit.

Reasons and rewards don’t necessarily have to be socially motivated. You might need a display photo to *something-not-socially-motivated, or your reward might be bonus points in a game product like *Duolingo.

### Use their existing social display photos

You can take advantage of the work the social media giants have done by simply grabbing the display photo from one of the user’s social networks. Many products now offer social logins, or allow you to connect your social networks after creating an account. If this suits your product, it’s a really simple way to practically guarantee getting a display photo for every user.

### Entice them

If there is no display photo uploaded, both Dropbox and Gmail show on placeholder to the user, and another to other users. You can use this to your benefit.

Daniel Eden of [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) said:

<div class="m-post-quote margin--none">
	<p>We ran an experiment to see what would encourage the most profile picture uploads - this character, or the user’s initials in a circle…the face holder character significantly outperformed the initials.</p>

	<p>The character lends itself a few things:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>It’s super cute, so people want to interact with it</li>
		<li>Unlike the initials, it’s clearly not a representation of the user’s true identity</li>
		<li>It looks like a placeholder. The dotted border just screams “change me!”</li>
	</ul>
</div>

Twitter does something similar. ………….

### Gravatar

Gravatar is interesting - and according to [UserOnboard](https://useronboard.com/)’s Samuel Hulick, *“seriously underused”*. Gravatar is a Global *R Avatar. If a user has uploaded an avatar on Gravatar, you and anyone else can grab it….

Many blog platforms use Gravatar to import a display photo with no effort from the user. However, this requires the user to have a Gravatar account already, and depending on who your product is aimed at, this could be only a fraction of your user base.
